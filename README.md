# is_real

Is this real?

A Rust library for something real, featuring:

-   Super easy checking real number via `is_real` function

## Usage

Add this to your Cargo.toml:

## Dependencies

If there's no problem using Rust and cargo, it will work well. The code is written in Rust version 1.65.0-nightly. I don't know whether it works in lower version. Who cares? ~~Is this real?~~
